# D3-Challenge
This program reads data from an attached CSV file containing census data from the united states, then creates a scatter plot based on two columns of the data and labels each point by the state assocated with that parcticular key-value pair. This is done by creating an SVG and all that is associated with it, such as the parameters, margins, etc. Then I appended the svg to the html file. Next came making the csv data into readable integers and using that data to form liner scales for the x and y axises. Afterwards I created a circle group, giving it a class that would allow the style css to set things like the fill and stroke. Once the circles had been made, i appended text to the data to properly label each circle before finally labelling the x and y axis.
